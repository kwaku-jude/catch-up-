# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Project

Welcome to the Airbnb Clone Project – a backend engineering challenge designed to simulate building a scalable, secure, and collaborative booking platform.

This project covers real-world engineering practices from database design and backend development to CI/CD pipelines and team roles.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build a scalable Airbnb-like booking application using Django and modern backend technologies.
- Strengthen team collaboration with clear documentation and role distribution.
- Practice secure, production-grade API development.
- Learn and apply CI/CD workflows to automate deployment processes.

## 👥 Team Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Backend Developer** | Builds API endpoints, handles business logic, manages routes and views. |
| **Database Administrator** | Designs and optimizes the schema, manages migrations, ensures data integrity. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Sets up CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and oversees deployment strategies. |
| **Project Manager** | Oversees task allocation, tracks progress, ensures delivery timelines. |
| **Security Engineer** | Implements authentication, authorization, and general API protection measures. |

## 🛠 Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Django** | Web framework for backend logic, views, and RESTful APIs. |
| **PostgreSQL/MySQL** | Relational database to manage persistent data like users, bookings, and properties. |
| **GraphQL (optional)** | API query language for flexible, efficient data fetching. |
| **Docker** | Containerizes the application for portability and consistent environments. |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automates testing, linting, and deployment with CI/CD workflows. |

## 🗄 Database Design

**Entities & Fields:**

- **Users**
  - id, name, email, password_hash, role
- **Properties**
  - id, title, location, description, host_id (FK)
- **Bookings**
  - id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), check_in, check_out, status
- **Reviews**
  - id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), rating, comment
- **Payments**
  - id, booking_id (FK), amount, payment_method, status

**Relationships:**

- A **User** can host multiple **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **Payment** is tied to one **Booking**.

---

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  Signup/login, password security, user profile, host or guest roles.

- **Property Management**  
  Hosts can create, edit, and delete properties, upload images, and view bookings.

- **Booking System**  
  Guests can view available listings, make bookings, and track status.

- **Review & Rating**  
  Guests can leave reviews after a stay; properties show average ratings.

- **Payment Integration**  
  Simulate or integrate a real payment gateway for transaction processing.

- **Admin Dashboard**  
  Overview of users, properties, bookings, and system analytics.

---

## 🔐 API Security

- **Authentication:** Token-based (e.g., JWT) for secured login and protected routes.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access for host, guest, and admin permissions.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse of public-facing endpoints.
- **Data Encryption:** Protect sensitive user data and credentials.

> Security is essential to protect user data, financial transactions, and the integrity of platform operations.

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically test, lint, and build the application upon pull requests.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploy to a testing or production environment.
- **Tools:**
  - GitHub Actions for running workflows.
  - Docker for containerization and portability.
  - (Optional) AWS/GCP/Heroku for hosting.
